For downloading ZIP files for above solutions, please go to my google drive location:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FQO9VRQ9IU-2Fid6937JLt678FgDFJav

Zip files are 100 MB and 80 mb about respectively and have venv folders too- good to download and run on Pycharm

Final solution 1 has HTML, CSS provided by Great Learning. Did not upload venv file as it exceeded 80 MB
Final solution 2 has my HTML CSS changes done during lab session.has the venv folder.
