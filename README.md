For downloading ZIP files for above solutions, please go to my google drive location:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FQO9VRQ9IU-2Fid6937JLt678FgDFJav

Zip files are 100 MB and 80 mb about respectively and have venv folders too- good to download and run on Pycharm

Final solution 1 has HTML, CSS provided by Great Learning. Did not upload venv file as it exceeded 80 MB
Final solution 2 has my HTML CSS changes done during lab session.has the venv folder. 

COULD NOT DEPLOY TO HEROKU AND RAILWAY APP AS BOTH ARE PAID AND ASKED FOR MY CREDIT CARD INFO WHICH I DID NOT PROVIDED. INCLUDED THE STEPS REQUIRED IN THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS.
